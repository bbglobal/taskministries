                    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                    <p>FLTC was established during a T.A.S.K. Ministries’ apostolic territorial insertion in Northern KY
                        that
                        expanded into an 18-month teaching assignment. This resulted in establishing a training center in
                        2018
                        purposed to equip the Body of Christ according to the purpose, call and destiny ordained by God.</P>

                    <h4>Teacher, Dr. P. Wise - Indiana</h4>
                    <p class="text-center">As a Fivefold ministry (Ascension Gift) teacher and an instructor and former
                        student of FLTC, I can’t
                        sing the praises of the groundbreaking work of Apostle Paula Wellings enough. I have often said,
                        “there needs to be an organized, systematic method to bring the body of Christ into an understanding
                        of the purpose, presence and power of the fivefold ministry gifts.” The Father has given Apostle
                        Wellings the answer.

                        The classes at FLTC are affordable and accessible in person or via zoom. The schedule of classes is
                        the result of thoughtful planning designed to meet the needs of the program and students. FLTC
                        offers a variety of materials in each course that not only support the learning outcomes but also
                        the spiritual development of students. FLTC is the gateway of Kingdom advancement that the body of
                        Christ has been waiting for.

                    <h4>Testimony: Pastor E.J.: Holloway - Maryland</h4>
                    <p class="text-center">In March 2023 I completed the Intermediate Apostle Training course. The course
                        material was phenomenal to say the least. The course material and reading were easy to understand,
                        yet filled with information and revelation that was undoubtedly given by God through His Word.
                        Completing this course has enabled me to identify the areas in our ministry where Apostolic
                        direction is needed while gaining an understanding of where I believe God is taking me in my
                        personal walk. Initially, I enrolled in the class to learn more about the office, but I left feeling
                        empowered, corrected, and poured into by Apostle Wellings. If you are looking to answer your call or
                        want a deeper understanding, ENROLL!

                    <h4>Evangelist B. Haynes - Northern KY</h4>
                    <p class="text-center">My first encounter with TASK Ministries Fivefold Leadership Training Center was
                        as a student where I participated in several classes including, but not limited to Leadership,
                        Office of the Evangelist, and Spiritual Warfare. I must say that the classes offered prepares you
                        well for any ministry that the Lord has called you to. I have received in-depth training and
                        valuable knowledge which has produced the confidence needed to be a powerful servant of God. All at
                        a minimum financial investment.

                        Now, having been invited by Apostle Paula to become an FLTC Evangelist Instructor, it has been an
                        honor to present these teachings to help equip the saints. The students that have participated have
                        increased their knowledge in evangelism, learning the many false religions they will come up against
                        and how to deal with them when witnessing the Gospel and also in Spiritual Warfare. They have gained
                        an understanding of who they are in Christ and the victory they have over all the wiles of the
                        enemy.

                        FLTC classes teach students exactly who and what they are battling, how to identify specific spirits
                        and how to engage the power of the Holy Spirit to set themselves free and to free others.

                        Many times it is not unusual for the power of the Holy Spirit to manifest in the midst of us through
                        the anointing of the lesson material!

                    <h4>Prophet Y. Berry: Fire on the Altar Ministries - Indianapolis</h4>
                    <p class="text-center">I have been a student of FLTC for three years completing prophetic classes
                        primarily during those years. The classes have provided clarity of the responsibility of my calling,
                        as well as allowing me to be trained with a company of prophets utilizing manuals and thorough,
                        detailed and the activations.

                        If you are looking to get clarity about your calling and sound instructions to operate in your
                        God-given gift, T.A.S.K. Ministries FLTC is for you. You will be encouraged and enriched from the
                        classes and prepared to pour out to others!

                    <p class="text-center">Since embarking on instruction through FLTC, my life has never been the same. As
                        a Pastor, I am grateful for who I have become because of the teachings. I have learned how to fight
                        effectively in the spirit realm having been taught the strategies and tactics of the enemy which
                        have proven to be exceptionally informative and comprehensive teaching.

                        As a four year pastoral student of FLTC, I have completed more than fifteen classes including, but
                        not limited to: The Pastor’s Mantle, The Pastor-The Sheep and The Church, Psalm 23, Discipleship,
                        and Firepower/Spiritual Warfare Master Class. The courses are amazing. The books and manuals are
                        straight forward, easy to comprehend and very informative.

                        Whether you are a fivefold leader, someone who is interested in learning how to function and operate
                        in your role as a leader or following your heart toward the call and destiny of your life, attending
                        T.A.S.K. Ministries Fivefold Leadership Training Center under Founder, Apostle Paula Wellings is a
                        must!

                        I continue to pursue being equipped, trained and taught by FLTC that prepares me to mature as a
                        servant, leader, and pastor in the Kingdom of God.
